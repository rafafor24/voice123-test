# Why vue.js for the front-end?
I decided to use vue.js for this project in order to challenge myself, this was the second time I used it. I have experience using React and Angular but for a while now I was willing to try something new and my friends and colleagues recommended vue.js and it is becoming popular, so I said: "Why not?"

# Code WorkLog
- 3pm: I read the test and started with the repository and the initialization with a Vue.js skeleton.
- 5-6pm Update the text area function so it triggers the search on enter, loading animation for the search and refactor routes.

- 8-10pm Material Cards with css for the CardsList and not refined algorithm for searching and highlighting result in paragraph. I placed the audio sources for the relevant audios
- 10pm-11pm I gave the page more style and beauty.

# Future improvements and recommendations.
- For the future i would like to try TDD and become proficient with it in vue.js+jest or maybe on another testing framework
- The algorithm for searching the terms in the paragraph can be improved and refactor so it is clear how its working right now
- Would be great to use a full Material Design for the style
- The page is lacking responsive behaviour so on mobile or smaller screens is not gonna look that great. That can be improved.
