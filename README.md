# Why vue.js for the front-end?
I decided to use vue.js for this project in order to challenge myself, this was the second time I used it. I have experience using React and Angular but for a while now I was willing to try something new and my friends and colleagues recommended vue.js and it is becoming popular, so I said: "Why not?"
# Code WorkLog
- 3pm: I read the test and started with the repository and the initialization with a Vue.js skeleton.
